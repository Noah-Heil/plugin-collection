So I finaly got aroound to actually doing something with the idea I had been kicking around. :Khappy:

My shis and outfits from before were kinda mhe, so I practiced a bit and was a bit more patient for this batch. I am actualy quite proud of how the ships turned out.

Here is the link, as per usual, unzip the file and put it in your plugins folder.

I am not responsable for your saves, and I can't promise that this file wont' don anything to them, but it should be safe.

Here is a copy and past of my about.txt:

Extremis Primarus 0.1

This is the first phase in a larger mod in which I hope to create a story that is in some ways an extension of the Endless Sky game, and in others a story entirely of its own.

The main purpose of Primarus is to create the resources for the later version of this mod. 

It is worth noting that this mod does and will modify several default stats, which is right now limited to increasing the amount of fighters and drones in stock ships, as currently stock fighters are simply useless.

Version 0.1: 
- Added several new ships belonging to the Arcadian Republic faction. They will likely be rebalanced in the future.

-Ranger: A durable heavy interceptor designed for large weaponry.

-Raptor: A Medium Warship with focus on combat instead of versatility.

-Glaive: a Heavy Carrier designed to carry a ton of fighters.

-Dace: A incredibly maneuverable fighter with a turret mount. It is very expensive and durable.

-There are some files for weapons, but they are not anywhere near done. They will likely be in the next release.

Version 0.1.1 goals: finish weapons and work on balancing. Maybe add a new ship or two.

Version 2.0 goals: Start work on next race: The Desradi Empire. 

Please comment any ideas/bugs/balancing ideas or whatever. 



Sorry for the bump, everyone, but:

If you're still working on this/interested in working on this in the future, you should probably move this to the Mods subforum.

On another note, the plug-in itself has many, many errors: the Dace has two blaster turrets, and only one mount. The Glaive needs a ton (not a literal ton) more weapon space, to fit its massive armament. All the ships (esp. Glaive) have an oddly low crew requirement - if this is intended, perhaps add something suggesting that in the description?

Edit: also, if you increased the Dace's weapon capacity by one, it could hold an anti-missile turret, which would be really useful to some. ;)
