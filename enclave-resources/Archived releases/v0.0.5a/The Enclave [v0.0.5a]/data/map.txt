	description `Affalan is deserted.	Enormous, bloated purple clouds roll across the landscape. Strange, mutated creatures roam the barren moors, and horrors lurk within the depths of Affalan's black seas.`
	description `	This eerie atmosphere is the result of extreme amounts of nuclear and biological weapons testing. When XSZ first began developing its nuclear arsenal, they needed somewhere to test, somewhere with a relatively normal ecosystem which was fairly uninhabited. Affalan was chosen, and a century later, the environment is so irradiated that you dare not step outside your ship without an extremely heavy radiation suit.`

planet Alleshafen
	attributes enclave
	landscape land/nasa1
	description `This planet is the home of the Enclave's largest ship manufacturing centres, much like Geminus in the Republic. While it is a relatively old world, the crust is composed mostly of very heavy metals and rocks, and so handily, the lighter metals which are useful for shipbuilding are found very near to the surface.`
	description `	Much of the land on Alleshafen, however, is relatively infertile, and as it seems that many types of life beyond basic plants have never developed, clothing, plastics and food are at a premium here.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Alleshafen is very heavily guarded; you and your crew were IDed when you landed, and there are enormous embankments in areas, presumably restricting access to the planet's shipyards. These embankments are watched all the time by groups of Enclave soldiers; they stand silhouetted against the evening sky, and while you are used to people holding weaponry by now, the sight of their very, very large guns still makes you a bit nervous.`

	attributes enclave

	description `Arikv was settled only fairly recently, according to the locals- the terraforming process is still continuing, which explains the humid conditions, and a decent part of the planet is still uncharted.`
	description ` However, this planet still boasts a shipyard and a comprehensive outfitter- doubtless due to its strategic position between XSZ and Enclave territory.`
	spaceport `This spaceport is armed to the teeth- ground-to-orbit weaponry is stationed around the main hub and landing pads, and the area is covered in mountains which you suspect contain a number of secret hangars, judging by the number of Enclave ships wheeling above on the atmosphere's edge.`
	spaceport ` When you first arrived here, you noticed the spaceport staff- as well as members of the public- looking at your ship oddly. While some appear to be considering coming over to you and asking where you found it, the vast majority of them do not.`

	description `As with the planet below, Bilbo was named after a character from The Lord of the Rings. This time, however, this moon was named "Bilbo" due to its odd similarity to the far eastern areas of Middle-Earth, to which the moon's namesake travelled during The Lord of the Rings' prequel. As a result, much of the terrain is tough and mountainous- perfectly suited to the dwarves of fantasy legend.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built into a lone mountain, a massive hive of tunnels extending throughout the edifice. Ships take off and land from landing pads suspended upon the sides of the mountain.`

planet Carmine

	description `	Pollution is a growing problem on Carmine; while it was originally perfect for human habitation worldwide, five hundred years of human occupation and industrialisation are beginning to increase global temperatures. As a result, many equatorial areas are growing more arid every year, and bleaching event's on the planet's legendary coral reefs are becoming more and more common.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a very ordered affair; everything seems to be sweeping glass and steel, with suited businesspeople everywhere looking really grumpy with everything.`

	description `Cavalier Station is a small facility which is used by XSZ to prospect through the rings of Crackle, hunting for ore-rich bodies, before giving them a well-aimed push down into the planet's gravity well.`
	description `	 As expected, the station is equipped with enormously strong shields; even the slightest hull breach could send the station tumbling off into the rings, knocking asteroids down onto the planet as it went.`
	spaceport `As you stepped off of your ship, the guards forced you to wear a small metal band around your wrist. Apparently, this band is designed to give the wearer an electric shock hard enough to knock them out, in order to prevent anyone from messing with the station's guidance or control systems without permission.`
	spaceport `	The rest of the spaceport is occupied by drones being serviced; presumably, these are what are used to shove asteroids around in the rings.`

planet Crackle
	attributes xsz
	landscape land/nasa2
	description `Crackle is one of XSZ's main manufacturing and mining worlds, thanks to the frequent impacts from objects falling out of the planetary rings above. While these impacts often throw up clouds of dust which may obscure the system's star for days or even weeks at a time, they both bring new material to the planet for mining, as well as digging out large craters, allowing XSZ to find elements usually found deep within the crust relatively easily.`
	description `	Most of the factories are situated well away from where the rings currently orbit; as the ring orbit moves north or south, the industrial centres move with it. They are designed to be able to be disassembled in mere weeks.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is filled with people; some poor and destitute, practically begging for a job here; some battle-hardened, the veterans of this mining world; and some families, seemingly carrying everything they own, waiting around to find a way of getting off this rock.`

	description `	Much of the surface is formed of ragged peaks and crags- presumably, this is as a result of the massive gravitational forces acting on the planet, yet which are unable to fully pull the planet into the black hole.`
	spaceport `Cromerium's spaceport is a series of very tall buildings. They appear to be sculpted out of a single piece of metal, without impurities, although you know that that is impossible. Landing bays for ships are on the sides of the buildings, fully automated- a ship can land, be refueled, repaired and recharged without a single spaceport worker needing to enter the hangar.`
	spaceport `	Oddly enough, there are no massive arrays of merchants here hawking their wares- it appears that all businesses are owned by the central Ascendancy government, and as a result, the trading areas are oddly calm.`

	spaceport `The main spaceport complex on Cynic is a flat, stumpy set of buildings towards the coast of Cynic's largest ocean. The whole thing is surrounded by a barricade of concrete walls, razor wire and presumably mines, almost ten yards thick- doubtlessly to protect the spaceport against the frequent political protests that occur on this planet.`

What's more, despite this system's relative proximity to Lyfon, the Enclave's capital, it is in fact well over two weeks' hyperspace travel away, making this one of the most remote and under-represented systems in the galaxy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a solid, unexciting structure built of blood-red bricks. The landing pads are packed earth, and although the refueling facilities are existent, only a few fuel hoses actually work.`

planet "Euclid Station"
	attributes xsz
	landscape land/space1
	description `Euclid Station is a small space station built by XSZ to monitor the condition of the irradiated planet below. As a result, there are very few facilities here for non-XSZ employees, even though there is a large team of over a hundred XSZ employees working here who, surprisingly, volunteered for this placement.`

planet Forefather
	landscape land/nasa3
	description `This planet is the home of the Ascendancy's revolutionary miniaturised outfits- but ironically, it appears to be the least efficient in Ascendancy space. Using strip mining and fossil fuels, Forefather stands out in stark contrast to other Ascendancy planets in its inefficiency, although results are results- it is here that most of the major Ascendancy technological breakthroughs have occured.`
	description `	According to broadcasts you received from the local government as you were coming in to land, inhabitants of Forefather are the happiest, on average, of any planet ruled by the Ascendancy. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is full of old takeoff gantries, like the ones that were used in the very first years of the space age to launch humanity's primitive rockets. While Ascendancy technology has obviously advanced far past this, it is interesting to see them testing such ancient techniques to see how effective they are.`

	description `	While most of the population here are farmers, taking care of and managing the countryside and living in rustic homes, a surprisingly large percentage of inhabitants find this world as dull as an old, musty sock, and are scraping together all the money they can possibly find to leave this planet far behind.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is extremely flashy for a planet like this. Although it does not use sweeping, graceful curves like many other spaceports do, it still has an atmosphere of class and optimism about it, all through the white-stained granite blocks that make up most of the buildings.`

	description `Helheim is not a pleasant place. Much of the surface is volcanic, pockmarked with crates and steam vents leading deep into the planet's crust. The air is slightly caustic, but breathable. However, it is also a world rich in easily accessible deposits of nickel, aluminum, and magnesium. The mining industry here has been booming for centuries, and in all of the Deep it is the one world where work is never hard to find - if you are willing to face the health risks and the lack of green and growing things.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is also the main city in Helheim, and it is built around a series of glass domes of all different sizes. Each dome is a greenhouse housing a different sort of plant life, and in some cases animals as well: hermetically sealed parks, protected from the caustic air outside, where the locals can come when their hunger to be among living things becomes unbearable. The docking bays each have an airlock to protect the atmosphere inside the city.`

	description `	Despite the large population, pollution on Imperative is nearly nonexistent; this is a direct result of the Ascendancy being far more long-sighted than many other human governments, including both the Free Worlds and the Enclave.`
	spaceport `Imperative has a number of spaceports dotted across the globe, although the main one is, obviously, located in the capital city. The main spaceport is built from a material which seems to defy explanation; the largest buildings bend and curve in an impossible fashion.`

	description `	Despite the large amounts of industry, Indefatigable is untouched by any major environmental destruction, and the skies are often clear enough that the stars can be seen every night, even in urban centres. The cold climate has not discouraged any settlers, either- thanks to the presence of the Ascendancy shipyards, work is always available.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is at the bottom of a large valley, a few miles away from the first urban areas. As you were bringing your ship in to land, however, you noticed a large network of security drones patrolling the airspace above the valley. Evidently, the Ascendancy is very mindful of security here, doubtless due to the shipyards.`

	description `	The central Enclave government is currently moving to transfer its main shipbuilding facilities here from Alleshafen in the Svind system, so that the bulk of Enclave military construction can take place in the southern arm of the galaxy, deeper into the heart of Enclave space. You have heard that there are also plans to construct an artificial ring around the planet on which ships can be built in low gravity, although there are no signs of its construction.`
	spaceport `There appear to be Enclave freight ships constantly landing and taking off from here, the materials for use in expanding the shipyards. A number of ships, almost as large as Republic Carriers, are circling the spaceport, although they are clearly not waiting to land, judging by the energy readings coming from their weapons.`

XSZ's largest shipyards are located here, meaning thousands of people migrate here each year to fill the massive number of jobs required to work in the shipyards, as well as the mines.`
	description `	Surprisingly enough, the relative background radiation levels here are abnormally low; despite XSZ's normal record of bad radiation safety, it appears that everything here is at least half lead, doubtlessly to prevent any possibility of workers being discouraged from coming to work here due to dangerous conditions.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a large, sprawling affair, taking advantage of the massive space afforded by being in an area that has already been exhausted of its raw materials.`
	spaceport `	A good third of the spaceport is filled by recruiting offices for various divisions of XSZ- XSZ Shipyards, XSZ Steel, XSZ Systems- and more. As a result, there are equally long lines of people, many of whom look desperate, queuing out of these offices in an attempt to secure a job for themselves.`

	description `	Mein is in the process of being accelerated towards its star through a gravitational slingshot effect provided by one of its planetary neighbours. This is slowly beginning to warm the planet's climate, although it may still take hundreds of years for Mein to be truly habitable.`
	spaceport `Your ship landed in the midst of a snowstorm, and you could hardly see where you were going as you ran inside with your crew. There appear to be very few people in this spaceport, little more than a skeleton staff, and while you know that you are safe inside from the ferocious winds, you cannot help but look around nervously whenever you hear the steel frame of the spaceport creak.`

planet Memorandum

The climate is stable and fairly warm, days are similar to those on Earth, and many of the inhabitants work in simple, boring office jobs which pay decently but are ultimately unexciting. The population is relatively low, too, although oddly enough, most families are in a very similar wealth band; poverty is mostly unheard of, and yet wild amounts of wealth are too.`
	description `	Very few people you meet have high aspirations for leaving the planet.`
	spaceport `The port staff are surprisingly cheerful, unlike just about every other human port you have visited, in this galaxy or the next. These are clearly the few people who, like you once did, want to leave this planet far behind in their own ship to become a trader, or a bounty hunter, or a warship captain. Their enthusiasm inspires an odd sort of nostalgia inside you, of the innocence you left behind when you joined the Free Worlds and their war.`

	description `Mirrodin is an advanced space station designed by the XSZ Corporation. Encompassing much of the Skryydr system, Mirrodin is somewhat like a Quarg ringworld, albeit that it is constructed with proportions more suited to your human psyche. Mirrodin, like an onion, consists of layers; the spaceports are situated on the outer edge of the ring, followed by the outfitters and shipyards, then the commercial band, and then the residential sector, facing the star in the centre of the system.`
	description ` Ironically enough, Mirrodin was built as a show of competition with the Enclave; building the most advanced station thus far constructed by humans is no mean feat, and placing it on the Enclave's doorstep, you suspect, was an intentional move in XSZ's cold war against the Enclave, not unlike that between the Deep and the Paradise Worlds in the Millky Way a few decades after the Alpha Wars.`
	spaceport `As you disembark from your ship, a number of advertisments boom through the hangar- "Welcome to Mirrodin! Now the most advanced entertainment and leisure centre in the galaxy!" "Over 100 kilometres of non-stop laser tag action, all for the low price of just 500 credits per person! Terms and conditions apply!" `
	spaceport ` The spaceport section of the space station is surprisingly clean and well-kept, unlike many you have seen in the Republic or the Free Worlds- most likely because this is the area receiving the station's residents, as well as those visiting simply for the enormous laser tag facilities.`

Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide.`
	description `	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a slick, clean, modern affair, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses.`

	landscape land/desert8-sfiera
	description `New Scotland is a world consistign of scrubland and low mountain ranges, for the most part; it is an old world, where tectonic activity is beginning to die down. As a result of the decrease in tectonic activity, the planet's magnetoshpere is also slowly weakening. This in turn increases the amount of radiation falling on the surface, making the inhabitants much more likely to get cancer.`
	description `	Most families live on isolated farms in the foothills; it would be even harder to get supplies to them if they were in the mountains proper, and the deep wastes are rumoured to contain dreadful horrors of the sands.`
	spaceport `As you stepped off your ship, the air already had a noticeably dry tang to it. The spaceport is situated in a large patch of desert, although the mountains nearby alter the weather enough to provide this area with some rain, at least. The architecture feels somewhat ramshackle, not unlike the frontier towns of the 17th century back on Earth; the roads are simply dusty trails, and the majority of buildings are constructed from wood.`

	description `	While it is one of the richest planets in the galaxy, Quaver is actually home to relatively few billion or even millionaires, as its massive wealth comes from its status as one of the primary trading planets away from the heart of Enclave space. As a result, there is a very well-funded welfare programme for inhabitants of the planet, which includes a universal basic income, something entirely unheard of in the Republic.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here feels vibrant and alive, the flow of goods and traders constant. Nobody is standing still; everyone has somewhere to be, although it seems that in this rush their regard for other people has not diminished- as you watch, someone is knocked over in the crowd, and instead of trampling over them like people from the Paradise Worlds would, a good five people stop to help them to their feet.`

These "dragons", however, are far more aggressive than those found on Skymoot, and are known to attack settlements regularly.

	description `	Termite's lightning is far, far stronger than on any other planet known to humanity, and as a result, whenever a bolt strikes, the enormous temperatures can actually fuse together hydrogen molecules found in the atmosphere to form helium. As a result, XSZ uses this planet as a massive, planet-sized fusion reactor in order to both generate large amounts of energy which can be stored and then shipped offworld, and to synthesise some rare elements via fusion.`
