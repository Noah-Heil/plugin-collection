			`Within a few hours, you find yourself standing in the central Senate hall, in front of a complete gathering of the Free Worlds Senate.`
			`One of the Senators- Arianna Huygens, the irascible one from Mere- is standing. "Well then Captain <last>. What are we waiting for? Please, enlighten us with Parliament's great proposal which they have been so enigmatic about."`
			choice
				`	"A new hyperspace link has opened between the Suhail system in the Deep and another, previously unidentified system. The Republic believes that the Pug are involved, and so they want a Free Worlds fleet to accompany a Navy division into the system in order to investigate it."`
					goto 1
				`	"The Pug are back. They've been meddling in the Deep."
					goto 2
			label 1
			`	There are a few scattered instances of murmuring between the Senators, and Arianna slams her fist down. "We are not the Republic's attack dogs!" she yells. Judging by the cheers she gets from the rest of the Senate, this is a popular sentiment.`
			choice
				`	"In their defence, the Pug are a galaxywide threat and so it's our responsibility as much as theirs to defend human space."`
					goto 3
				`	"I'd be willing to take the mission on with my personal fleet."

			`	The Senator from Zug clears his throat loudly. "Why is this at all relevant to the Free Worlds? We're a good two weeks travel away from there, anyway."`
			choice
				`	"A new system has appeared- Parliament wants a Free Worlds fleet flying alongside the Navy ships that are going to be investigating."`
					goto 1
				`	"'In the interests of galactic safety', Parliament wants a Free Worlds fleet to help the Navy investigate what's been going on."`

			`	The Senators consult amongst each other for a few minutes, before eventually falling silent.`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>, of the Free Worlds, you have the Senate's official permission to take a fleet of Free Worlds warships to the Deep in order to deal with the potential Pug threat," Arianna says, albeit with a tangible distaste in her voice.`

			`	The Senate seems to be agreeable to this proposal; you spot a large number of nodding heads. "Very well," Arianna says. "You will travel to Helheim in order to rendezvous with the Navy, and from there you will assist in the Navy's investigation, Captain."`
