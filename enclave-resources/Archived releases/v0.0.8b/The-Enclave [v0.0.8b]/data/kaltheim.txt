	description "The Heat Redistribution Ray is the Kaltheim's primary cooling method; by using some very complicated physics, they are able to trap superhot particles within a beam, which can then be fired at an enemy ship. The excess heat required for this weapon is sourced from the other outfits installed on a ship, providing the cooling effect."
	description "	This weapon is entirely unhindered by shields, instead piercing through to transmit heat directly to the enemy ship's hull. As a result of the increased heat upon it, this often causes the hull to begin to warp, causing a small amount of damage."

	description "The Tundra-Class Shield Generator is the smallest Kaltheim shield system. Designed to absorb energy from the projectiles which it deflects, this allows smaller Kaltheim ships to operate only on relatively small generators. The dissipation effects used by Kaltheim shields also allow them to cool their ships when being fired on."

	"shield heat" -7
	description "The Glacial-Class Shield Generator is the next step up in Kaltheim shielding technology. It employs better cooling, energy absorption and shield generation than Tundra shields in order to provide a more efficient shielding system for larger Kaltheim ships."

	description "The Lenmig'sraor 52-T is a somewhat antiquated Kaltheim design, from the days before they began ramping up for the invasion. The original versions were equipped with a number of fighter bays, but in the run-up to war many were heavily modified to become hunter-killers, sacrificing the fighters in favour of more maneuverability as well as more gun slots and turrets."
	description "	While the old versions of the ship are rarely seen nowadays, when they are deemed suitable for a battle they are a major force on the battlefield."
