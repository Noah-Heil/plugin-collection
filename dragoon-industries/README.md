[MOD] Dragoon Industries
Hey, just put together a mod for this game, its not that great at the moment but it does have a little bit of stuff in it.

Here is the information for the mod, if anyone has any sugestions/tips on how to balance and or add new things il try to do that.

What this mod does is it currently adds a few ships that are basically blank slates and have lots of room for you to upgrade and outfit with your own systems and the like.

The 3 ships are a small fighter/cargo kind of ship, a large warship, and a very large ship

Currently a little unbalanced

It adds 3 Ships that have no stats except for outfit space

Adds 2 Sub-Systems for increasing engine and weapon point
Adds 4 Sub-Systems to increase Hull points
Adds 3 Sub-Systems to increase Shield Points
Adds 1 Sub-System that Repairs Hull

To add some form of ballance, I made it so there is a new system that only sells the ships and parts, if you want to know where the ship is its on the edge of known space west of Sol
