Mod: Tecnological revolution
First of all, This bravely clasifies as a mod, because it had way too much copy and paste to call it that, but I think some people here will enjoy it so let me explain
I modified some of the game mecanics in a way that (I believe) will give the player more opportunities when it comes to create an ideal fleet
here are the modifications:
-korath World-ships now come with jump drive. this meant that if you actually manage to steal them, you can take them back.
-Nerve gass has more damage, but not much (3.8). this makes them worth getting fined
-New "hand to hand" weapon: radiation cannons. ridiculous attack damage(50) but it takes both outfit space and weapon capacity, its expensive, and you can be fined with 10M if the navy gets you
-Interference Plating needs only 2 outfit space each now, and you can install Interference Hull, that gives you almost 100% protection against scanners, but it needs 60 of outfit space
-Bunk Room and Small Bunk Room now give more bunks(15 and 5), so that they are worth the outfit space they take
-outfits Weapon Expansion, Engine Expansion, Hull improvement, Shield improvement added, so you can create your ideal ship
-Pirated combat drone added, so that carriers are more useful one you have one. thay are also modified(and balanced I hope)
-new weapons: small javelin pod (faster, smaller pod and more capacity that normal javelins, this way fighters can overwelm anti missiles turrets, they don´t actually do much damage) Titan anti-missile system(a super anti-missile turret that can protect an entire fleet, but that needs alot of energy, outfit space and cooler systems) and Particle Heavy machine gun (a particle canon with more firing rate, more range but with alot of requeriments)
-all interceptors and fighters are cheaper now(my plan was to lower death beneficts, but I don´t know how)
I think that´s all
to "install" it, take the .txt files in this link:

and drop them in your data folder. you can buy every new outfit only in the pirate worlds. I will probably modify in the future the IA´s ships to have this outfits installed, but not yet
please tell me if any of this modifications is too OP and such. also you are free to make any modifications, I do not own anything and whatnot
last but not least enjoy it

honestly I made this a year and a half ago just to make some easy modifications and I didn´t plan on doing nothing else with it, but lately I have been playing the game again so I overhaul it. don´t expect much tho
