	description `Although the protector was as fearsome as any heavy warship, it's combination of slow engines and short range ended up making it as combat - worthy as it was visually appealing. Although the Watchdog shares many of the problems with it's previous edition, it's new upgrades have made it able to quickly shred anything within range. However, you might have to do a few favors to get your hands on one.`

	description "This is arguably the most powerful combat ship ever built by humans (if it was built by humans). Two large, hollow chuncks of hull have been welded to the cetner, and are used as cargo holds. The drone bays have been filled in by outfits, and it seems some parts have been laced with nuclear missles, which are rigged to explode when the ship takes too much damage. Despite it's origins, this ship was a flagship; all the other members of it's fleet existed to disable ships so that this cruiser could steal their cargo and outfits. It also still has the bunks, and is more than prepared to board a ship if it appeals to the captain."
