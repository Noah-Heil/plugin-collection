	description "Similar like a normal outfit expansion, but it can be done more precisely. It will actually have more cooling problems than a larger expansion, but on a smaller scale."

	description "Exactly like a normal cargo expansion, but it can be done more precisely. Although cargo expansions do not cause cooling problems, you can't have any outfits installed in a cargo bay."

	description "The ultimate in expansions. You can add as many of these as you want, but anything that uses this will take twice the weight that it normally would. Not reccomended for use on speed based ships."
	description "It will also interfere with your cooling systems. This is only really a bad thing if you try to add a large amount of these."

	description "In some ships bunks become so underused that they start to become cargo bays. For a price, you could get this done in a professional manner. It's not the most efficient system, but if you have nothing else to use the bunks for, why not?"

	description "This is the smallest set of plasma thrusters that are mass produced by Delta V. They are usually added onto ships that are alrady well over the size these are capable of moving, to fill in the last few bits of engine space."
	description "	Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."
