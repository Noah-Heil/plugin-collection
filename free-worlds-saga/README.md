Initial work done by Ian C

Ok, so as mentioned earlier, posted as very initial set of missions for feedback please.

I know I need to go back and do some work on the narrative, etc. but would like to see how people think these feel at this stage before I continue going down the route, especially as I haven't story boarded the whole thing out yet...

To do:
Link up to the main storyline completion better (currently triggers off the final Darnforth conversation only)
Check that all pre-conditions are set (e.g. check for cargo space, etc.)
bolster the narrative
balance some delays in the storyline (currently relatively short to support testing [10 days])
add payments for missions (my current test pilot net earns per day so balancing payments has not been a priority)
develop a graphic for the transmission encryptor - currently using scanner image as a place holder (help welcome!)
decide if the transmission encryptor has any utility in the long term (thoughts welcome!)
based on the above, add encryptor to the extremist ship loadout...
spell check the whole thing

Any comments (bugs / typos / etc.) welcome, please treat as a 0.1 release though in terms of my QC to date - most of the progress has been proving I can write a mission that will run and trigger!

Thanks for time...
