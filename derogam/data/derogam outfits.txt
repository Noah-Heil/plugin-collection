outfit "Blaze Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 709000
	thumbnail "outfit/blaze core"
	"mass" 11
	"outfit space" -11
	"energy generation" 1.9
	"heat generation" 4.9
	"energy capacity" 400
	"shield generation" .045
	"shield energy" .045
	description `While its design may not suggest it, the Blaze Core was developed not too long ago to both satisfy the demand for an even smaller reactor and to enable a size increase for others of its lineage.`

outfit "Ember Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 1856000

	"energy generation" 4.4
	"heat generation" 11.6
	"energy capacity" 900
	"shield generation" .11
	"shield energy" .11
	description `For a long time, this generator served as the backbone of all smaller ships in Derogam space. Due to recent technological advancements, it was made slightly bigger and more powerful after an even smaller version was developed.`

outfit "Flame Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 4837000

	"mass" 57
	"outfit space" -57
	"energy generation" 10.5
	"heat generation" 26.7
	"energy capacity" 2150
	"shield generation" .24
	"shield energy" .24
	description `Throughout the centuries, the Derogam generators changed drastically, but every new generation has always been based on modifications on this very generator. This means that some traces of older generations could still be found in its inner design, however small.`

outfit "Inferno Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 8506000

	"mass" 90
	"outfit space" -90
	"energy generation" 17.45
	"heat generation" 43.15
	"energy capacity" 3200
	"shield generation" .38
	"shield energy" .38
	description `This generator is a staple for both smaller ships that barely manage to fit it in, and larger ships that pair it with other generators. Even though larger ships are usually better off with a bigger generator, merchant captains often prefer a cheaper version, due to the limited amount of combat they may face.`

outfit "Magma Core"

	"mass" 123
	"outfit space" -123
	"energy generation" 25.1
	"heat generation" 60.65
	"energy capacity" 4550
	"shield generation" .53
	"shield energy" .53
	description `Most larger warships simply can't function properly without a generator of this caliber. While recently its demand went down due to an even bigger version based on it, the Magma Core still serves as the backbone of most medium-large ships.`

outfit "Searing Core"
	category "Power"
	cost 18861000

	"mass" 162

	"energy generation" 34.7
	"heat generation" 82.2
	"energy capacity" 6250
	"shield generation" .67
	"shield energy" .67
	description `With the development of both the Guardian warship and a new line of generators, there was a huge demand amongst captains of such large ships for a new, even bigger generator to power its systems. Rumor has it that it was developed in only a fifth of the time it took to create the generator it was based on.`
