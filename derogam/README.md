# Important
All outfits are placeholders until I make MY OWN.

# The Derogam
This is my first actual Endless Sky project, and the goal is to add new alien species to the game with this plugin. I'm hoping to merge this with the base game once done.


# Who/what the Derogam are

They're dragon-like aliens. They'll be very advanced, balanced around the Heliarch, Wanderers and Korath Automatons, with interesting, new, and hopefully original distinctions.

For example, a medium/long ranged gun and turret with mildly inaccurate partially piercing projectiles (Railguns), a torpedo that launches, stops, then accelerates (Accelerator Torpedo), and a big slow turning turret that does only ion, disruption and slowing damage (Pestilence). Some bigger military ships even get small integrated bonus stats (from their "vein" technology: the orange tubes on larger warships), like a little energy generation, shield regeneration, hull repair and battery. Their ships also have high heat dissipation and built-in heat.

# Who/what the Nekis are

Similar to humanoid tigers (cat-like people, not nekos, kys). Throughout the story you'll basically learn that they're travelling searching for new systems, for who knows what reason. I won't spoil much else besides that they'll be an enemy in the story... But who knows if they may become friendly?

# "Schedule"

Read the "queue" list & the "working on" list: https://trello.com/b/aM2pteNE/derogam

# Planned ships: (they have placeholder outfits until I make my own, and this is more of a "remember" page for myself as well)

This does NOT mean I won't make more ships, maybe I will, it just means that this is the "core", after this I'll do other stuff first.

DEROGAM MILITARY SHIPS:
implemented:
- 1 Light Warship (Derogam Sentry)
- 1 Medium Warship (Derogam Assassin)
- 2 Heavy Warships (Derogam Warrior) (Derogam Guardian)

not implemented yet:
- 1 Interceptor (Derogam Rogue)
- 1 "Gunship" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Renegade); More guns, no turrets, agile, fragile, and will have 1-2 Fighters(??).
- 1 "Light Carrier" (Medium Warship) (Derogam Knight); Weak on its own.
- 1 "Heavy Carrier" (Heavy Warship) (Derogam Sentinel); Strong on its own.
- 1 Fighter (Derogam Prowler); durable like the Sestor fighters.

DEROGAM CIVILIAN SHIPS:
implemented:
- 1 Small Freighter (Derogam Gatherer)
- 1 Medium Freighter (Derogam Collector)
- 1 Large Freighter (Derogam Hoarder)
- 1 Medium Transport (Derogam Itinerant) (REWORK NEEDED)

not implemented:
- 1 Small Transport (Derogam Disciple)
- 1 Large Transport (Derogam Wayfarer)
- 1 Small Hybrid (Derogam Mingling); Hybrids are Transports & Freighters in one
- 1 Medium Hybrid (Derogam Hybrid)
- 1 Large Hybrid (Derogam Amalgam)


NEKIS MILITARY SHIPS (more to be added):
implemented:
- 1 Heavy Warship (Nekis Predator)

not implemented:
- 1 Light Warship (Nekis Pillager)
- 2 Medium Warships (Nekis Striker) (Nekis Demolisher)
- 1 Heavy Warship (Nekis Executioner)

NEKIS CIVILIAN SHIPS:
- 1 Large Hybrid (Nekis Voyager); Lore-wise it's their biggest civilian ships for long journeys, compare in to Korath World-Ships but meant for travel (but actually balanced).
